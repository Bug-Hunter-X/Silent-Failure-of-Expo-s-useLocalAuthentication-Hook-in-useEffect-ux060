This bug occurs when using the Expo `useLocalAuthentication` hook in conjunction with a `useEffect` hook that attempts to authenticate the user on component mount.  The authentication process may fail silently, leaving the application in an indeterminate state. This is often due to the asynchronous nature of the authentication process and the timing of the `useEffect` cleanup function.  The authentication request might still be in progress when the component unmounts, leading to an error or unexpected behavior.
